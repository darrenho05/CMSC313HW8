The purpose is to create a matrix library in both C++ and C


matrix.cpp - uses 2d vectors to create and manipulate matrix objects, defined as a class in the file
    The user must manually input the values into the matrix, and the main calculates the given expression.
    Each operation updates the current matrix object, but if there is two matrices involved in the operation, the second one is unchanged.

matrix.c - uses pointers, struct, and memory allocations and frees to create and manipulate matrices
    Just like the .cpp file, the user must manually input the values into the matrix, and main calculates the given expression.
    Each operation stores the result in the first matrix and does not change the second one
